1. Project Summary
==================
1.1 Purpose, scope, and objectives
----------------------------------

The main purpose of this project is to create a working scheduling webapplication with specific support for mobile devices like smartphones and tablets that enables (authorized) users to query their personal course/final schedule and notifies them about last-minute changes. We will call this application:  `Xiast`*(**X**iast **i**s **a** **s**cheduling **t**ool)* More specific requirements can be found in the [SRS](#SRS) (Software Requirements Specification) document.


The main system itself uses the `Wilma` server of the university as back-end and a normal or mobile browser as front-end.


All documents, source code and other artifacts are publicly available on Github. Documents can be found under [xiast-docs](https://github.com/se1-1314/xiast-docs), source code can be found under [xiast](https://github.com/se1-1314/xiast).

This academic 3rth bachelor project is part of the course "[Software Engineering](#SoftEng)", taught by dr. R. Van Der Straeten taking place at the "Vrije Universiteit Brussel"

<!---
The scheduling application itself must be usable in an academical context to schedule courses and finals fully automatical while violating as least constraints as possible. All this must take place in the most optimal way. When a schedule has been generated automatically it must be possible to manually change it afterwards by an authorized user. Every (authorized) user must be able to view his or her personal timetable */
