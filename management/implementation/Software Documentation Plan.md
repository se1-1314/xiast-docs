# Software Documentation Plan

## Introduction

This document describes the information that our documentation must contain. It will also describe the methods that will be used to generate documentation for the source code. Software documentation comes in two different forms. Documentation for the end user and documentation for developers. This Software documentation plan only handles the creation of developers documentation

## Purpose

The purpose of the created documentation is for the reader to understand the code and be able to write additional functionalities relying and using the documented code without having to read the source code.
